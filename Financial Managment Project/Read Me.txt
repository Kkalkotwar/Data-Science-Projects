This project is based on a financial management problem which every industry needs to face. 
In this, we have scraped the money control website to gather the Balance Sheet, 
Profit Loss Statement and Cost Statements so that they can be used for gathering the financial ratios, which will help investors to predict 
if they should invest in that company or not.
